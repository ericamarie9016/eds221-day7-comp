## Joins

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

animals <- tibble::tribble(
             ~location,   ~species,  ~maturity,
              "lagoon",   "bobcat",    "adult",
               "bluff",   "coyote", "juvenile",
               "creek",      "fox",    "adult",
                "oaks", "squirrel", "juvenile",
               "bluff",   "bobcat",    "adult"
             )
sites <- tibble::tribble(
           ~location,      ~full_site_name, ~jurisdiction,
             "beach",       "Goleta Beach",     "SB City",
            "lagoon",        "UCSB Lagoon",        "UCSB",
             "bluff",       "Ellwood Mesa",     "SB City",
              "oaks", "Fremont Campground",        "USFS"
           )
sites2 <- sites |> 
  rename(loc = location)
```

### Full Join

```{r}
full_join_example <- full_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
full_join_ex2 <- full_join(animals, sites2, by = c("location" = "loc"))
```

### Left Join

```{r}
left_join_example <- left_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Inner Join

```{r}
inner_join_example <- inner_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Semi Join: Filtering join

```{r}
semi_join_example <- semi_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Anti Join: Filtering join

```{r}
anti_join_example <- anti_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```
